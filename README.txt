Xenophone

For SuperCollider 3, all code under the usual GNU GPL 3 license, see the COPYING file.

Installation:
Put this folder in your extensions directory (location will depend on your platform, run Platform.userExtensionDir in SuperCollider). If you need further hints on how to do that, see the [Using Extensions] help file in SuperCollider.

If you are on Mac, the code will use the SCImage class to flash up an alien language document with each run (image copy saved to the SuperCollider temp directory). Example language text will also go to the post window on all platforms.

The project contains a subfolder, "IR" which contains some example impulse responses from open internet sources (links in the Xenophoneclient.scd file, files renamed for convenience). If anyone has an issue with reuse of these impulse responses here, I am happy to remove them as required. Impulse responses can be mono or stereo but 44.1KHz is typically expected. Feel free to substitute any sound files, conventional impulse response or not, into your local copy of this folder.
